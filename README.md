## Background

This is a challenge completed on Front End Mentor as I'm keen to start building things again from a greenfield perspective

## Solution retrospective

## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I got through this challenge fairly quickly, I think it's pretty close to the design files. going forward I'll be using tailwind and rem as measurements as pixels as a measurement can be restrictive.

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

The only challenge I really had was deploying this!!! Github pages is a tough deployment for a nextjs static page, in particular dealing with images and public folders.

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

I'm happy with the outcome.
