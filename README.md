## Background

This is a challenge completed on Front End Mentor as I'm keen to start building things again from a greenfield perspective

## Solution retrospective
What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I'm particularly proud of the responsiveness of this page and it was good to reintroduce myself to css. I would potentially use sass or tailwind in future projects.

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

I only had a few challenges. Initially the switch to mobile gave me some issues until I understood the @media concepts in css. I also had some issues with github pages, in particular the image basepaths but thankfully I worked these out looking online.

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

I'm happy with my project as it is.
